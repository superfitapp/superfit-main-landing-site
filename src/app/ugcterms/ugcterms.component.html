                You certify that you are at least 18 years of age.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</strong>
                The Site, SuperFit Services or SuperFit Properties may be protected by copyright, trademark and other
                intellectual property laws. You acknowledge and agree that you do not acquire any ownership or other
                rights in proprietary information and materials of SuperFit by authorizing use of your User Content or

                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>
                These Terms of Use are personal to you and may not be assigned or transferred by you for any reason
                whatsoever without SuperFit’s prior written consent; and any action or conduct in violation of the

                You agree that if SuperFit does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in
                these Terms of Use (or which SuperFit has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be
                taken
                to be a formal waiver of SuperFit’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to
                SuperFit.
                <br>
                <br>
                If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these
                Terms of Use are invalid, then that provision will be removed without affecting the rest of the Terms of
                Use. The remaining provisions of these Terms of Use will continue to be valid and enforceable.
