                    <strong>B.</strong>
                    <strong>Arbitration</strong>. Please read this carefully. It affects your rights. SuperFit and you
                    (such
                    references include
                    our respective predecessors in interest, successors and assigns) agree to arbitrate all disputes and
                    claims arising
                    out of or relating to this Terms of Service between SuperFit and you. The arbitration shall be
                    governed
                    by
                    the
                    Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
                    Disputes
                    (collectively,
                    "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Terms of Service,
                    and
                    shall be
                    administered by the AAA. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this
                    arbitration clause,
                    but the arbitrator is bound by this Terms of Service. Except as otherwise provided for herein,
                    SuperFit
                    will pay
                    all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either
                    the
                    substance
                    of your claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted, as measured by the standards set
                    forth
                    in
                    Federal
                    Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), then the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules.
                    In
                    such case,
                    you agree to reimburse SuperFit for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your
                    obligation to
                    pay under the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator grants relief to you that is equal to or greater than the
                    value
                    of your
                    demand, SuperFit shall reimburse you for your reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and expenses incurred
                    for
                    the arbitration.
                    You agree that, by entering into this Terms of Service, you and SuperFit are waiving the right to a
                    trial
                    by jury.
                    You and SuperFit agree that YOU AND SUPERFIT MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS
                    INDIVIDUAL
                    CAPACITY, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative
                    proceeding.
                    Further,
                    you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and
                    may
                    not otherwise
                    preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is
                    found
                    to be
