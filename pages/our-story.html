                Hi, I'm Leo, the founder of SuperFit. My mission is to help people of all
                experience levels meet their sports goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                I believe that sports should not only be about competition; it’s about community, having fun and
                personal
                growth. SuperFit strives to improve the learning process in sports and fitness, so whether you’re
                already
                playing
                in a league and want to reach the next level,
                or just starting out and learning the ropes, SuperFit is there for you — every step of the way.
                <br>
                <br>
                But that's not all.
                <br>
                I know that there are a ton of workout apps out there already. My mission is beyond the confines of a
                gym
                or basketball court. I want to level the playing field so that more people can begin a sport of their
                interest. I hope SuperFit can help shape the world of sports to be more approachable and open for
                everyone.

                My Story
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm a 27 year old Asian American born in NYC. From as early as I could remember, I loved
                playing Basketball. I was raised by a single mother in Flushing, which is a very dense area in Queens,
                NY,
                populated mostly with East Asians.
                <br><br>
                There wasn't a whole lot to do in Flushing besides eating food or going
                to the park. In fact, within a 3 block radius from my apartment, there are three parks with basketball
                hoops
                in each of them. I guess my passion chose me. Basketball was the one thing that got me through
                highschool,
                college and to where I am today with SuperFit.
              </p>
              <br>


              <h4>When I was 10,</h4>
              <p>
                my mother forced me to learn how to swim. No one ever taught her growing up, despite how much she
                loved being around water. It's no
                coincidence the first sport I learned and became good at was swimming. My mom worked two jobs waiting
                tables, my aunt who lived with us was a cook at a Malaysian restaurant
                down the street from home. Toys? No. DSL internet? Definitely No. But my mom was serious about having me
                take
                group swim lessons on the weekends. I still remember every tier level in the lessons pamphlet for that
                swim
                program:
                beginner, intermediate, advanced, club.
              </p>

              <h4>12</h4>
              <p>Thinking back, I was a pretty good swimmer. I wasn't on Junior National swim circuit or anything, but
                at
                13, I was decent enough to be one of the fastest sprinters at my local Boys' Club swim team - the Abbe
                Panthers. We traveled to meets on the weekends, competing with other clubs in the NYC area. I
                experienced
                what winning as a team felt like, as well as how awful losing can be. I also learned what
                respect felt like, especially as a nerdy Asian amongst a dense Black
                and Latino community. I never wanted to let my teammates down, because I could always hear their insane
                cheering through the water the entire race.</p>

              <h4>14</h4>
              <p class="lead">
                Did I mention I did not like to swim?
              </p>
              <p> I used to say I hated swimming, but that's not true; I went along with
                it
                because I was decently good. I just always loved basketball. I had taken a few basketball lessons too
                growing up,
                but not <em>nearly</em> to the extent of time I spent learning to swim. By my first year in highschool,
                I
                told myself I'm done with swimming. I got booted off my highschool team
                pretty early on because I skipped practices. I
                just didn't care — I wanted to be GOOD at basketball.
                <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Quitting was not hard.</em>
                <br>
                Telling my coach and teammates on the Abbe Panthers was the crushing part. These were
                my childhood friends and quitting the team felt like quitting on them. They took it pretty hard,
                especially
                my coach. He believed in me and I think he felt I was tossing away something good.
                <br><br>After I gave the news,
                I
                remember doing a
                couple laps alone on an easy summer afternoon. My coach walked over to my
                lane one last time and we slowly
                talked about my decision to leave. I don't remember much from the conversation, but the know how it
                ended:
                He told me that if I
                stayed with him and the team, he would personally teach my mom how to swim on the weekends. At an early
                age,
                I learned what it's like to make hard decisions for yourself.
              </p>

              <h4>17</h4>
              <p>
                I tried out for my highschool basketball team 3 times after I quit swimming. Every year I didn't make
                it. I
                trained and practiced almost every day — what am I missing? I played on non-profit and church teams
                outside
                of school, but I thought nothing compared to playing on your school's varsity basketball team. I even
                served
                as a manager on the team for one year. While my friends hung out after school, I was rebounding
                and helping a sub .500 basketball team do drills and run sprints.
                <br>
                <br>
                Watching the varsity team practice made me realize I was so far off from my ambitions. I was 5'8 and
                didn't
                know how to play organized basketball. I was just
                a street ball player. Some of those kids learned to play basketball even earlier than
                when I started learning to swim. I had a lot of catching up to do.
              </p>

              <h4>18</h4>
              <p class="lead">
                College
              </p>
              <p>
                I applied and got into the University at Buffalo for Marketing Management. I loved entreprenuership and
                learning how to attract customers to something worth buying. But on the Summer before freshman year, I
                looked through the university's undergraduate catalog and noticed the school offered a degree in
                'Exercise
                Science'.
              </p>
              <p>
                Wait.
              </p>
              <p>
                I read more about the 4-year program. I had never heard of the terms 'Kinesiology' or 'Exercise
                Science', I
                didn't even know
                you could get a degree in those fun domains! I was a B student with 0 extracurriculars besides playing
                basketball after school for 3 years. Despite all that, I focused my entire college application process
                on
                majoring in business and marketing — I didn't plan on throwing all that effort away into this new idea
                that
                popped up.
                <br>
                <br>
                One thing did feel certain. I was way more excited reading about the Exercise Science program than I did
                thinking about marketing. Several days later, I emailed admissions at the university. I took the jump.
              </p>

              <h4>20</h4>
              <p>
                If I couldn't make it onto my highschool basketball team, you know there was no darn way I would make
                the
                Division 1 Basketball team for Buffalo. But if you're like me, you think anything is
                possible. I tried out my freshman year and got the results pretty quick. I stopped trying out for
                basketball
                teams. Instead I had a new plan, which was playing Intramural League Basketball at our
                university.
                <br>

                Anyone can sign up for Intramural Sports; you can either form your own team or join a group that needs
                players. Say what you want about intramural basketball — this became the hallmark of my 4 years at
                Buffalo,
                and it's where I cemented my passion for sports performance and training.
                <br>
              </p>
              <p class="lead">
                We treated intramurals like it was the NBA.
              </p>
              <p>
                The friends I met early on from pickup basketball became the founding intramural team I named, 'Splash
                Ent.' (Ent. short for Entertainment). I don't remember what inspired the name, but we kept that identity
                for
                all 4 years I attended Buffalo. By the 3rd year, everyone knew who 'Splash Ent' was, 'that one team that
                practices together all the time and takes the league way too seriously'. Yeah — that was us, and we
                loved
                it. <br>
                <br>
                Our team would strength train and shootaround in the mornings, and whomever was free in the
                evenings
                would play full-court pickup games together. Don't get me started on our weekends. <br>When we trained
                in
                the mornings, I
                would have everyone's workout program on a clipboard, marking sets complete with the amount of weight
                lifted
                or reps done. You could say my first strength coach job was with the 3-4 teammates on our team
                motivated enough to train with me.

                End of College
              </p>
              <p>
                College wasn't all pickup basketball and intramurals, as much as I tried for it be. I graduated with a
                Bachelor's in Exercise Science, with a ton of real-world experience and shadowing opportunities under my
                belt. I lived in Denver for 5 months interning for the NBA Strength Coach who
                trained Steve Nash while on the Phoenix Suns'. I also spent a summer down in Pensacola, Florida
                interning at
                Athletes' Performance (now called 'EXOS'), the company famously known for preparing the top NFL draft
                players each year. Growing up in New York all my life, it was a culture shock living down south.
                Football is
                everything, and playing sports in general is just bigger there. Even though I never played football, I
                thought the level of preparation and immersion of sports in people's daily lives was beautiful and
                something
                I never felt in New York City.

                My First Job
              </p>
              <p>
                I was lucky in getting a job right after my internship at Athletes' Performance. Through some terrific
                referrals from my past mentors at other internships, the Sports Medicine staff at New York University
                saw enough potential in me and hired me on as an strength coach to assist with just about every Varsity
                sport at NYU. I got paid so little; my first year, I think it was 12k for a 9 month contract (summer
                attendance is not required in the Summer for D3 sports). Nonetheless, it felt like a dream job. What I
                was
                doing with my intramural team at Buffalo, I was getting paid to do at NYU, with way more athletes at
                once. I
                learned so much during my two years there, and made some unforgettable friends too.

                I initially planned on leaving NYU to become a physical therapist. I wanted to advance my career
                and I felt like a rational step was to pursue a Doctorate in Physical Therapy. I was inspired by how
                meticulous
                performance therapists at EXOS would approach each athletes pre and post workout. Everything was
                documented
                and their treatment approaches seemed so innovative. I wanted to do that.
              </p>

              <p class="lead">
                An online course changed everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                I applied for Early Decision to Duke's Physical Therapy program. I made it to the onsite interviews at
                Durham,
                North Carolina, but ultimately was rejected. Option B was NYU Physical Therapy's interviews 4 months
                later
                (I
                got into the program). But two events happened from the time I read the rejection email from Duke to
                when I
                read the acceptance email from NYU. #1: I took a free online course on Tech Entreprenuership by Stanford
                University. That lead to #2: I wanted to make my idea of digital sports training and coaching a reality.
                That
                meant I needed to learn how to code. Coding bootcamps were becoming very popular around 2015, and I knew
                that
                if my plan failed, I'd still be in a better position financially in my career since it seemed like
                programming skills were in very high demand.
                <br>
                <br>
                I turned down my acceptance into NYU Physical Therapy and never looked back. This decision was one
                of the most important decisions in my life and SuperFit may have never started had I not enrolled in
                that
                free
                online course.

              </p>
              <p>
                I never thought I could build a mobile app on my own and publish in on the Apple App Store, and then
                SuperFit 1.0 happened. I was very happy that day.
